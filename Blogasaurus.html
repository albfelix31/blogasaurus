    <div id = "quickFacts">
      <h2> Who am I? </h2>
      <p> Well hello there, awesome reader of this
        super amazing blog of mine! My name is Albert Felix,
         and yeah, sometimes I wonder who I am, too.
        But <a href="...">
        here</a> you can find some quick info on who I am!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id = "background">
      <h2> Where do I come from? </h2>
      <p> I wasn't born in the United States. I come from a small island
        from the Caribbean called the Dominican Republic. If you want to know
        more about my upbringing there, click <a href="...">here</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id = "academics">
      <h2> Schools! </h2>
      <p> I went to a private school when I lived in the Dominican Republic.
        Then I went to a public school for Hispanic immigrants when I moved here.
        And now I will be attending the Macaulay Honors College at CCNY this fall!
      </p>

    <div id = "freeTime">
      <h2> How I (poorly) spend my free time </h2>
      <p> I spend most of my free time binging on Netflix, watching Game of Thrones,
        exploring around Central Park, taking pictures with my Polaroid, and reading fiction books.
      </p>
    </div>


    <!-- <h2> How I Spent My Summer </h2>

    the Dominican Republic.
     I like photography,<br>
    and taking pictures with my Polaroid. I like exploring Central Park and <br>
    going geocaching, too.

    <p> I read books, explored Central Park,
      and took pictures. My grandparents visited me, too, and
      we traveled <br> around New Jersey.
      I also had a great time participating in the Google CSSI!
